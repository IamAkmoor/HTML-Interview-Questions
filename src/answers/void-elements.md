## What are void elements in HTML?


A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.

HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void
elements. For Example &lt;br /&gt;, &lt;img /&gt;, &lt;hr /&gt;, etc.
