## What are HTML Entities?

In HTML some characters are reserved like &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;/&rsquo;, etc. To use these characters in
our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities. Below are a
few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be
used.
