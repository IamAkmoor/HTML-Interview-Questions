## What is Webworkers?

A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

Use cases:
 - Prefetching and/or caching data for later use.
 - Polling and processing data from web services.
 - Processing and display of large data sets (think genomics)
 - Computations related to moves in a game.
 - Image processing and filtering.
 - Processing text data (code syntax, spell checking, word count)
