## What are tags and attributes in HTML?

Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be
structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to
define the characteristics of the element. For example, &lt;p align=&rdquo; center&rdquo;&gt;Interview
questions&lt;/p&gt;, in this the &lsquo;align&rsquo; is the attribute using which we will align the
paragraph to show in the center of the view.

HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content. HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.
